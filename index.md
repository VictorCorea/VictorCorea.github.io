### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite because it designed game. Although very simple, the game could involve 2 people and leads to a connection between one another. Additionally, the concept is simple enough for the very beginning of coding meaning anyone can learn how to code the game.
* Lab 5

    Lab 5 part 2 was a favorite because blackjack is a game I am very familiar with. Writing the code for the functions seemed very long and I was very engaged by how all the functions were used in the main function together. The code called upon itself in multiple aspects, teaching the importance of functions in preventing repetition.
* Lab 8

    Lab 8 part 2 was a favorite because it was a program that visited a similar concept I had failed to come up with a solution with years back. Seeing the solution was refreshing and helped me see nothing is unsolvable. I see this program as the culmination of my skills into becoming a proper beginner programmer.
